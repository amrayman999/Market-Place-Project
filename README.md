## Project Overview

This project is a **simulation of an online marketplace** developed as part of a **Database College Course**. It demonstrates the integration of a Windows Forms application with an Oracle database to simulate the functionality of an online marketplace.

### Features

- **User Management**: Admin and user sign-in functionality.
- **Product Categories**: Manage and interact with various product categories such as electronics, clothes, food, and more.
- **Database Integration**: Built using Oracle Database to store and manage data.
